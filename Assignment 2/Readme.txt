Part 1: 

Question 1: The results are saved in a state called, "1dData.pvsm". Please use the "Load State" option in ParaView to see the results in form of a table, histogram, and line charts. The bin count for the histogram is 100 but can be changed for other tests. 

Question 2: The results are saved in a state called, "2dImageVis.pvsm". Please use the "Load State" option in ParaView to see all the results in form of a thresholded image, original image, and a histogram of the data. All the values like bins in histogram, min and max in threshold can be changed to obtain a different set of results. 

Question 3: The results are saved in a state called, "meshVis.pvsm". Please use the "Load State" option in ParaView to see the required results. Each Rendered View window has a title so as to facilitate the reading and understanding. 

Question 4: The results are saved in a state called, "3dImageVis.pvsm". Please use the "Load State" option in ParaView to see all the X, Y and Z Normal Slicing individually as well as together. 


Part 2:

Question 1: 
i) To get the required Structure of 16 arrows, open ParaView -> Python Shell -> Run Script. Chose the script as "Part2_Q_5_1.py". It will automatically render the required structure. The state file is also available named as "A2P2Q1_1.pvsm"

ii) Similar to the previous part, load the script "Part2_Q_5_2.py" to render the structure with extracted edges and shrink. The state file is also available named as "A2P2Q1_2.pvsm"

Question 2:
The steps to execute here are;
- Open Paraview and Load "2d.vti" Dataset
- Open Python Shell and run the Script "Part2_Q_6.py" 
- Just wait for it to load all the results in the 3 rendered windows. 

The state file is also available named as "Question6.pvsm"
